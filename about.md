Le Petit Chou (meaning “The Little Cabbage”) is the musical project of artist, composer, and producer Alex Liu. His eclectic musical tastes take him from the structures and musical language of classical music to the storytelling and lyricism of hip-hop and folk music. He takes just as much from movies as he does from the atmospheric and ambient textures of electronic music. With his wry sense of humour and abundant use of irony, he often layers darker and more serious undertones that reward multiple listens.

In the summer of 2021, he released his first full-length project, [*From, 2*](/music).
